# ExerciseTracker

Console based CRUD application to record exercise data. Developed using C# and SQLite, Entity Framework Core and Dependency Injection.

## Given Requirements
- [x] This is an application where you should record exercise data.
- [x] You should choose one type of exercise only. We want to keep the app simple so you focus on the subject you're learning and not on the business complexities.
- [x] You can choose raw SQL or Entity Framework for your data-persistence.
- [x] he model for your exercise class should have at least the following properties: {Id INT, DateStart DateTime, DateEnd DateTime, Duration TimeSpan, Comments string}
- [x] Your application should have the following classes: UserInput, ExerciseController, ExerciseService (where business logic will be handled) and ExerciseRepository.
- [x] You can choose between SQLite or SQLServer.
- [x] You need to use dependency injection to access the repository from the controller.
